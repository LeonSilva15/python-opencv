# Python OpenCV

This project is intended to be a simple reference or guide for using OpenCV with Python.

#### Resources
In case  you want to know more about any of these:
| Topic | Documentation |
| ------ | ------ |
| Python 3 | https://docs.python.org/3.7/ |
| Open CV | https://docs.opencv.org/4.2.0/ |

## Installation
Add dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Run
The files and folders are named using numbers in order to make it simple to follow as a tutorial:
```sh
cd python-opencv/python-opencv/<#_topic>
python <topic_subtopic>.py
```

***This is Work In Progress, so I'll be adding more Python code using OpenCV.***
